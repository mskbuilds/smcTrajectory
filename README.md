Sliding mode control is a well established method for continuous and discrete plants. The controllerâ€™s ability to reject noise and remain robust is one of its unique features. Al- though it is quite an established method, it has been gaining popularity recently due to its perfect nature for robotic systems. A lot of robotic applications require a defined tra- jectory to execute, this is both for concerns of safety and the efficiency of the application. Sliding mode control not only fits this application but can be extended to other non linear applications quite effectively. This project implemented the sliding mode control on a UR5. There are many applications where this could be used, however this report focuses on the application case of pick and place. The results are also provided which shows the controller was able to follow a given trajectory with great accuracy.
